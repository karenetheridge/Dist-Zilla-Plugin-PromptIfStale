          - now also checks the configure and build prerequisites

          - when killing a build after being prompted, include a line that can
            be copy-pasted to install all the missing modules via cpanm
          - speed up index querying when checking for 6 or more modules at
            once by pulling down a copy of 02packages.details.txt.gz

          - diagnostic message added before checks begin, so the user isn't
            wondering why the build/release appears to hang (querying the
            index can take a little bit of time if there are a lot of modules
            to check)

0.005     2013-09-16 00:05:07Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - now only prompting once (per phase) for all discrepancies found
          - no longer prompting for the same module twice, if there are
            multiple instances of the plugin running

          - New "check_all_prereqs" option
          - warnings tests bypassed during installation

0.003     2013-09-05 07:45:52Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - gracefully handle checking for a module that is not installed
          - support setting both the check_all_plugins and module configs at
            once

0.002     2013-08-12 18:04:29 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix documentation that referred to an option by the wrong name
          - inverted prompt, from "abort build?" to "continue anyway?" (with
            the default remaining as aborting the build/not continuing)
          - version checks are bypassed for modules provided by the dist being
            built

0.001     2013-08-11 21:20:18 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - Initial release.
